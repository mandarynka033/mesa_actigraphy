The development of wearable, smart devices paved way for sustainable monitoring of quality of sleep. Actigraphy readings can be used to estimate the sleep-wake cycle and calculate summary statistics of the participantâ€™s circadian rhythm. Activity values vary less while at rest, so the proposed Hidden Markov Model is based on consecutive, absolute activity differences, modelled as a mixture of zero-inflated Gamma distributions.
The algorithm achieves accuracy of 77.8% and it not limited to only high quality data. Rhythm index can be calculated based on the classification to aid in fast recognition of patients with disturbed sleep patterns.
